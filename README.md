gfwl-stripper
=============

Tool to remove GFWL header from savegames (originally, Batman games)

Version 1.3

Instructions:

- Unzip the folder somewhere, open it and start GFWL-Stripper.

- Select your game.
- Check if the detected folder corresponds to where your old GFWL-savegames are.
    If it doesn't, click "browse" and select the correct folder.

- Click start.

- Return into the GFWL-stripper folder, there should be a directory with the same number as the GOTY edition of your game (e.g. 35140 or 200260).

- Browse to your "steam cloud" data:
    e.g.: C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\userdata\<userid>\

- Backup the folder with your game ID:
    e.g.: 35140 for AA:GOTY or 200260 for AC:GOTY

- Replace the directory you just backed up by the one in the GFWL-stripper folder and overwrite everything.

- Play your game.
