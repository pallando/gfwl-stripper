gfwl-stripper
=============

Tool to remove GFWL header from savegames (originally, Batman games)


Instructions:

- Unzip the folder somewhere, open it and start GFWL-Stripper.

- Select your game.
- Check if the detected folder corresponds to where are your old GFWL-savegames.
    If it doesn't, click "browse" and select the correct folder.

- Click start.

- Return into the program folder, there should be a directory with the same number as the GOTY edition of your game (e.g. 35140 or 200260).

- Browse to your "steam cloud" data:
    e.g.: C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\userdata\<userid>\

- Backup the folder with your game ID:
    e.g.: 35140 for AA:GOTY or 200260 for AC:GOTY

- Place the newly created folder from the program directory where was the one you just backed up.


- ADDITIONAL STEP FOR Arkham City: rename your new savegames by removing your gamertag from them:
    "<gamertag>-saveX.sgd" shoud become "saveX.sgd"

- Play your game.
